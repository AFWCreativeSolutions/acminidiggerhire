Can‚Äôt recommend these guys enough!
Absolutely amazing service from Stephen at AC Mini Digger Hire!

From the planning stage right up to completion Stephen is extremely knowledgeable in the field ‚Äúno pun intended‚Äù and helpful throughout the whole of my complex project! I will recommend him to my friends and family and I‚Äôll be sure to return in the future!

He was super friendly, punctual and a pleasure to deal with, no hassle, straight to work and a hard worker at that ‚Äúrare quality these days‚Äù he likes a good cup of tea and a chat so be sure to stock some Yorkshire tea and some biscuits and he will sort the rest! Thanks again AC team
